## Index Opening Range Guardian for MT5

`Experts/IndexOpeningRangeGuardian.mq5` is a conservative MetaTrader 5 Expert
Advisor designed for the M5 timeframe on US index CFDs:

- US30
- US500
- USTEC

The EA trades a New York-session Opening Range Breakout (ORB) rather than a
continuous scalping system. Public strategy references consistently emphasize
that raw ORB entries are vulnerable to false breakouts, so this implementation
adds filters and risk controls:

- 30-minute opening range by default
- M5 candle-close breakout confirmation
- EMA 20/50 trend alignment
- M15 EMA 200 directional filter
- ADX directional-strength filter
- ATR-based range quality, stop, trailing, and spread filters
- Tick-volume participation filter
- One trade per symbol/session by default
- Daily equity drawdown guard
- Fixed-fractional risk sizing in the account currency

There is no such thing as a strategy that is both guaranteed safe and guaranteed
profitable. Treat this EA as a robust, backtestable starting point. Run Tickmill
strategy tests and forward demo tests before live use.

## Tickmill / ZAR account notes

The lot-size calculation uses `OrderCalcProfit()` to estimate the loss for 1 lot
from entry to stop-loss. MT5 returns this in the deposit currency, so on a
Tickmill ZAR account the risk amount is calculated in ZAR automatically.

Default risk is intentionally modest:

- `InpRiskPercentPerTrade = 0.35`
- `InpMaxDailyLossPercent = 1.20`
- `InpMaxPortfolioPositions = 3`

If the calculated volume is below the broker's minimum lot, the EA skips the
trade by default instead of exceeding the configured risk. You can change this
with `InpAllowMinLotIfRiskTooLow`, but leaving it `false` is safer.

## Installation

1. Copy `Experts/IndexOpeningRangeGuardian.mq5` into your MT5 data folder:
   `MQL5/Experts/IndexOpeningRangeGuardian.mq5`
2. Open MetaEditor.
3. Compile the file.
4. Attach it to one chart. It scans all configured symbols itself.
5. Ensure the symbols are visible in Market Watch.

The default symbol input is:

```text
US30,US500,USTEC
```

If Tickmill appends suffixes such as `.cash`, leave
`InpAutoResolveSymbols = true`; otherwise edit `InpSymbols` to the exact broker
names.

## Important setup inputs

All session inputs are broker/server time:

- `InpSessionStartHour = 16`
- `InpSessionStartMinute = 30`
- `InpOpeningRangeMinutes = 30`
- `InpEntryWindowMinutes = 150`
- `InpSessionCloseHour = 22`
- `InpSessionCloseMinute = 45`

Tickmill server time may shift with daylight saving. Confirm the broker time
that corresponds to the US cash equity open before enabling live trading.

## Recommended validation process

Backtest each symbol separately first, then the three-symbol portfolio:

1. Use "Every tick based on real ticks" if available.
2. Test at least one volatile period and one quiet period.
3. Validate spread assumptions around the US cash open.
4. Optimize only a small set of inputs at a time:
   - `InpOpeningRangeMinutes`
   - `InpEntryWindowMinutes`
   - `InpMinRangeAtr` / `InpMaxRangeAtr`
   - `InpRewardRisk`
   - `InpMinAdx`
   - `InpVolumeMultiplier`
5. Forward test on demo before live use.

Avoid curve fitting. The goal is a stable ruleset, not a perfect historical
equity curve.
